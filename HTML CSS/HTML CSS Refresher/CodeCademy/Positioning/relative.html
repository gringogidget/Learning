<!-- Relative positioning is more straightforward: it tells the element to move relative to where it would have landed if it just had the default static positioning.

If you give an element relative positioning and tell it to have a margin-top of 10px, it doesn't move down ten pixels from any particular thingâ€”it moves down ten pixels from where it otherwise would have been.
