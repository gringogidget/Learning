//There are two ways to access the properties of an object: the dot operator (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.

//The dot operator is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

//Here is a sample of using the dot operator (.) to read an object property:



// Setup
var testObj = {
  "hat": "ballcap",
  "shirt": "jersey",
  "shoes": "cleats"
};

// Only change code below this line

var hatValue = testObj.hat;      // Change this line
var shirtValue = testObj.shirt;    // Change this line
