<h1>Pick Your Character (w Sound)</h1>
<h3>This is a snippet to use if you want to rotate characters to pick at the beginning of a game.<br>Watch out for the sound levels 🎶 
(still not sure how to equalize)</h3>
<p>Click on the arrows and the things in the middle and it should make sounds. Animations by me. Sounds clipped by me.</p>
