- Use the `init` method to define game settings
- Spritesheets have a `margin` around them, and a `spacing` between frames
- Keep variables in the `this` context to access them from different methods

- To enable input on a sprite set `inputEnabled` to `true`
- to enable dragging first enable input, then call `enableDrag()`
