<!-- Whoa, <div> got huge. That's because the background color is the same for the content and the padding.

When you give CSS a positive padding or margin value, it puts that space between the element and its reference: for instance, if you have a <div> and you give it a margin-left of 20px, it puts twenty pixels between the left margin of that <div> and the side of the screen. This effectively moves the <div> twenty pixels to the right.

If you want to move an element in the other direction, you can give CSS a negative value: margin-left: -20px will move the element twenty pixels to the left. -->
