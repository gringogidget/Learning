CSS Refresher
<!-- While <div> allows you to divide your webpage up into pieces you can style individually, <span> allows you to control styling for smaller parts of your page, such as text. For example, if you always want the first word of your paragraphs to be red, you can wrap each first word in <span></span> tags and make them red using CSS! -->

	<body>
		<p>This text is black, except for the word <span style="color:red">red!</span></p>
